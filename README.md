Some suggestion:

Everything is hard at the beginging.

Use all resources including preofessors, TA, classmates, USTF, chatgpt, google, github

After completing the project, use the following commands to check:

devtools::build_vignette()

devtools::document()

devtools::test()

devtools::check()

and finally which is also the most exciting command:

#devtools::build()
