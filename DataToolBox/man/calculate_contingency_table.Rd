\title{Chi-square Test for Independence from Contingency Table}
\usage{
calculate_contingency_table(observed, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A matrix where each element represents the count of observations for the combination of categories from the two variables.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used to determine the critical value for the hypothesis test, default to be 0.05 (typically set between 0.01 and 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and the decision to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of independence.
}
\description{
Performs a chi-square test of independence between two categorical variables
represented in a contingency table (matrix of observed counts). This function
computes the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value to evaluate
whether there is a significant association between the two variables.
}
\examples{
observed = matrix(c(10, 20, 20, 40), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
result = calculate_contingency_table(observed, alpha = 0.05)
print(result)
