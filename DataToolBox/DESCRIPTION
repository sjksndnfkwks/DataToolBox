Description: This package helps to conduct data visualization, data cleaning, 
    outliers handling and distribution checking on the data set. It also helps 
    to select regressor variables based on forward or backward methods and 
    provides the regression result with corresponding response variable and 
    selected regressor. Besides, it provides some vectorized hypothesis such as 
    t-test and so on for you to check. What's more, this package also has 
    functions to get contingency table and sample size needed to achieve a 
    desired error in estimating a population proportion with a specified 
    confidence level.
